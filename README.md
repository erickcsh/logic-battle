# Logic Battle

Logic Battle is a mobile-web application that allow users to create
rooms to play with their friends and strangers through small fast games
of 10 questions.

The questions enforce logical mathematical reasoning on the users,
taking advantage of friendly competition to improve the speed to answer
these types of questions through real-time feedback.

To avoid users answering randomly, wrong answers are penalized with
minus 75 points, while correct answers add 50 points to the score
